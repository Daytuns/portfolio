            These three words drive how I approach life, learning, and problem-solving. <br /> <br />
            I graduated from John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. During this time I had the opportunity to learn across disciplines, from embedded systems to creative design. <br /><br />
            Outside of engineering, I find joy in the simple and meaningful things: playing and watching soccer, spending time with my three energetic Chihuahuas, and having conversations that dive into people’s passions. I’m also deeply drawn to visual art. The idea of communicating ideas, emotions, or stories through visuals fascinates me and influences how I think about technology and design. <br /><br />
            Whether it’s through code, circuits, or conversations, I’m always seeking to grow, connect, and contribute.
